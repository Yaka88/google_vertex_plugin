// - contents ending with the model's turn: Vertex answers 400 "Requests ending
//   with a model turn are not supported" (Codex compacting on a Gemini model).
//   A user turn goes after it, as Gemini CLI keeps its history ending.
// - contents opening with the model's turn (what an agent's compaction can
//   leave): "function call turn comes immediately after a user turn". Gemini
//   CLI's hardenHistory puts a user turn before it, and so does this.
// - a user turn holding a tool's functionResponse and the user's text: Vertex
//   takes the two as separate turns and answers the same "ending with a model
//   turn" 400, so the text goes in a user turn of its own after the responses.

// What the user turn put after the model's last says: the summary the
// compaction asked for, or to go on.
